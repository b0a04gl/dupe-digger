The New York-based company listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $10 billion to $50 billion in a Chapter 11 petition filed in New Jersey. The filing allows WeWork to keep operating while it works out a plan to repay its debts.

The company reached a sweeping debt restructuring deal in early 2023, but quickly fell into trouble again. It said in August that there was “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue operating. Weeks later, it said it would renegotiate nearly all its leases and withdraw from “underperforming” locations.

WeWork’s real estate footprint sprawled across 777 locations in 39 countries as of June 30, with occupancy near 2019 levels. But the enterprise remains unprofitable.

The company went public in 2021 through a combination with a special purpose acquisition company, two years after its planned IPO was infamously scuttled amid investor concerns about the company’s governance, valuation and growth prospects. The failed deal led to founder Adam Neumann’s resignation as chief executive officer and led to a dramatic slide in WeWork’s valuation, which once stood as high as $47 billion.

Other shared office space firms have also stumbled after the pandemic upended working habits. Knotel Inc. and subsidiaries of IWG Plc sought bankruptcy in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Fellow tech giants Infosys and TCS have already asked their staffers to come to office at least 10 days a month and five days a week, respectively.
Starting November 15, Wipro employees will have to work from office at least three days a week, the company has conveyed to its staffers, joining fellow tech giants Infosys (10 days a month) and Tata Consultancy Services (five days a week) in mandating a hybrid work policy.

According to Moneycontrol, the employees received an email on Monday, informing them about the company's decision. The email contained a message from Saurabh Govil, Chief Human Resources Officer, Wipro.

“Starting November 15, all employees must be present at their assigned office location for at least three days each week. This change aims to enhance teamwork, facilitate face-to-face interactions, and strengthen Wipro's culture,” it quoted Govil as saying.

The Bengaluru-based IT major and India's fourth largest software services provider will, however, customise the policy on the basis of the country a staffer is based in; local legislation, and agreements. Also, for European nations, consultation with employee representation groups could be used to define such guidelines.

‘Work from office or else…’
Additionally, the email carried a warning that people violating the guidelines consistently will face ‘consequences’ starting January 7, though it did not specify what these ‘consequences’ will be.

“We firmly believe that accountability is essential for the success and growth of our organisation,” it read.

The possible consequences, as per the Moneycontrol report, could include: a loss of trust and credibility with managers and leaders, reduced performance and work quality, increased stress, conflicts, and dissatisfaction within teams. In addition to these, disciplinary actions could also be taken by the management.
