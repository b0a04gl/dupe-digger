# DupeDigger - The Duplicate File Detective! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hey there, mate! Welcome to DupeDigger - the Duplicate File Detective! This fella here's your go-to buddy when you've got a file mess so big, you'd need a map to find your way out. Let's dive into the madness and sort things out, shall we?

## The Story

### A Standalone Start

DupeDigger started as a simple solo act. It was like Batman in his early days, fighting crime one file at a time. No fancy gadgets, just a one-man show in a digital world full of chaos. 

## The Grand Plan

Now, we're cooking up a grand plan for DupeDigger, and it's happening in stages:

1. **Stage One: Serial Sleuth (Done)**

   - Our first version works on a single thread. It's like the "Once Upon a Time" version.
   - You can tell DupeDigger what size of files to look for, and it's going to stick to the mission.
   - Don't want to see those sneaky hidden files? No worries, just turn on the "No Hidden" mode!

2. **Stage Two: Scaling Up (In Progress)**

   - Here's where things get interesting. We're adding more threads and letting DupeDigger multitask like a pro.
   - It's like going from one detective to a whole team of sleuths. Faster, smarter, and ready for bigger gigs.

3. **Stage Three: Super Sleuth (Coming Soon)**

   - In the final stage, DupeDigger's going to be like Sherlock Holmes, but for files. Expect smarter moves, speedier results, and a friendlier user experience.
   - We're tossing in extra features to keep your files organized and your digital life as smooth as a double shot of espresso.
